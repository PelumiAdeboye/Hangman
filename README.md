# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Milestone 1

- The first step is setting up the GitHub repository for the Hangman Project.
- It involves creating the necessary files and documents that showcase professional documentation habits.

## Milestone 2

- Created a list containing the name of 5 fruits and assigned the list to the variable word_list.
- With the use of the module `random`, a random word is selected from the list.
- The user is asked to input a single letter.
- Conditional checks are created that must be passed before the input is accepted. 

## Milestone 3

To define the functions `check_guess` and `ask_for_input` for the Hangman game, I followed these steps:

- First, I defined the `check_guess` function which takes a guessed letter as a parameter and checks if the letter is in the secret word. I passed the guess as a parameter to the function and converted it to lowercase to ensure that the game is case-insensitive.
- Next, I defined the `ask_for_input` function which is responsible for asking the user to guess a letter, checking if the input is valid, and checking if the guess is in the secret word. The function will continue to ask for input until a valid guess is made.
- I also called the `check_guess` function from within the `ask_for_input` function to check if the guess is in the secret word. The `check_guess` function takes the guess as a parameter.
- Finally, I called the `ask_for_input` function outside the function definition to test the code.

## Milestone 4
### Class Definition

The Hangman class is defined in the `milestone_4` file. It has the following attributes:

- `word_list`: A list of words from which the game selects a random word.
- `num_lives`: The number of lives the player has to guess the word. Default value is 5.
- `list_of_guesses`: A list that stores the letters guessed by the player.

The class also has the following methods:

- `__init__(self, word_list, num_lives=5)`: The initializer method that sets up the game. It takes the `word_list` and `num_lives` as parameters, where `word_list` is a list of words and `num_lives` is an optional parameter with a default value of 5. It initializes the attributes `word`, `word_guessed`, `num_letters`, and assigns a random word from `word_list` to `word`.
- `check_guess(self, guess)`: A method that checks if the guessed letter is in the word. It takes a `guess` parameter and compares it to the letters in the word. If the guess is correct, it updates the `word_guessed` list and decreases the `num_letters` count. If the guess is incorrect, it reduces the `num_lives` count.
- `ask_for_input(self)`: A method that asks the player to input a letter guess. It validates the input and checks if the guess has already been made. If the input is valid and a new guess, it calls the `check_guess` method and updates the `list_of_guesses`.

## Milestone 5

The `milestone_5.py` script has been added to provide a complete game execution. It includes the following:

- The `play_game` function: This function takes a `word_list` as a parameter. It sets the number of lives to 5, creates an instance of the `Hangman` class, and enters a while loop to continue the game until a game-over or victory condition is met. It calls the `ask_for_input` method to get the player's guesses and checks for the necessary conditions to break out of the loop. At the end, it prints appropriate messages indicating whether the player won or lost the game.

To play the Hangman Game, run the `milestone_5.py` script and pass a list of words as an argument to the `play_game` function. The game will interactively prompt you for letter guesses and provide feedback on the correctness of your guesses.

Example usage:

```python
word_list = ["apple", "pear", "pineapple", "guava", "banana"]
play_game(word_list)
